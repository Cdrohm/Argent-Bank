***Argent Bank is a new bank looking to break into the sector. We will help him set up his application.***

## Use an API for a bank user account with React
- **Phase 1: User Authentication - Creation of a web application allowing customers to log in and manage their accounts and profile**

- ** Phase 2: Transactions - This would be to specify the API endpoints needed for a possible second mission once we have completed the first**

# **1. BACK END API**

You need to fork this repo: https://github.com/Cdrohm/Project-10-Bank-API and follow instructions in readme.md for get the API.

*This specific code is to be used to use all the features present in the frontend application.
The original code provided having been modified, please use the one provided in the previous link.*

URL/PORT
The default micro API URL is http://localhost:3001


# 2. FRONT-END

The FRONT-END code of the application is available on this repository. The npm or yarn package manager is required.
- Please clone the project locally:
` https://github.com/Cdrohm/Argent-Bank.git`

- Then navigate to your local repository and install the dependencies using:

`npm install`

- Launch the application with:

`npm start`

## USE

Two profiles are preloaded in order to test the application:

1. TONY STARK
`Email: tony@stark.com,
Password: password123`

2. STEVE RODGERS
`Email: steve@rogers.com,
Password: password456`

*You can create a new profile, however, the "transaction" part will be empty, as the application is under development.*

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
